# Frankie Bot
Frankie Bot is named after Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. 

Frankie currently uses a Jetson TX2 as the on board computer with the ROS operating system, YDLIDAR X4, 9DoF Razor IMU M0, Zedd Camera, Arduino microcontroller, VESC speed controller, default RC motor, chasis, and wheels. A SSD card was used with the Jetson TX2 for more storage capacity. 

To Get Started: 
The Jetson TX2 is an ARM architecture and comes flashed with a linux flavored operating system. If you decide to utilize an external SSD then you will need to flash the SSD with Jetpack.
